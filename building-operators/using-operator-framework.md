# Using the Operator Framework

The Operator Framework is a family of tools and capabilities to deliver on the customer experience described above. Itâ€™s not just about writing code. Testing, delivery, and updating Operators are just as important. The Framework components consists of open source tools to tackle these problems:  


* **[Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk)** - build, test and package Operators
* **[Operator Lifecycle Manager](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager)** - controls the install/upgrade/RBAC of Operators on a cluster
* **[Operator Metering](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-metering)** - collecting operational metrics about Operators on the cluster for Day 2 management and aggregating usage metrics

In addition to the Operator Framework, OpenShift OperatorHub provides an interface for discovering, installing, and managing Operators on OpenShift clusters.

These tools are designed to be composable, so you can use any that are useful to you.
