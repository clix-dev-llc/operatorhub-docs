### **Red Hat OpenShift Operator Certification** 

Software providers that embrace the Operator Framework and want to target enterprise environments can pursue [Red Hat OpenShift Operator Certification](https://connect.redhat.com/en/partner-with-us/red-hat-openshift-operator-certification). Through this offering, partners can verify the functionality of an operator and its dependencies on Red Hatâ€™s container platform, OpenShift.

Certified operators offer end users a broad range of applications and infrastructure that can be managed in a consistent manner, across both private and public clouds. OpenShift Certified Operators are backed up by collaborative support between Red Hat and our partners, extending trust from the container platform to the application stack.
