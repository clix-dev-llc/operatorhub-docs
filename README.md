# Introduction

## **Operator Developer Guide**

Red Hat strongly believes that Operators provide the best Day 1 and Day 2 management experience for modern applications. Red Hat’s goal is twofold:

1. Provide a set of tools to build high quality Operators that fulfill the promise of hybrid cloud
2. Provide a discovery and distribution method to connect Red Hat customers with partners that solve the customer’s business problem\(s\) with Operators. Red Hat needs you – as the expert in your arena – to make our customers successful.
